I participated in the development of Risk management project and Trainee system in which I am assigned in the development of the APIs pertaining in the permissions of the member. I am also participating in the development whenever we have a new game, the third party sends us demands that contain different APIs but I focus in the API that is used in retrieving records.
I provide technical support to customer service in resolving data discrepancies regarding the members' missing records, duplicate records, game name null and checking for unsynchronized data in third party's site.
I am also in charge of coordinating with third party's partner provider whenever we encounter problems with pulling up records.

Iteration flow:

1. since we follow agile software development using scrum, We will have our Sprint planning or requirements review 
2. daily scrum meeting this also includes the task delegations
3. 1 week development for the Iteration tasks
4. do some joint debugging with frontend before the smoke test for FAT environment deployment
5. 2-3 days for bug fixing if there is some bugs that occur during the First round of testing
6. if all bugs are fixed and there is no more issues we proceed with UAT until Production deployment

Importance of unit testing
  With the use of unit testing we will be able to detect the bugs early and we can ensure the code quality. Unit testing also serve as a form of documentation so that it will be easier for the developers to understand how the code should behave and how its intended to use.
