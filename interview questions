List features of the Java Programming Language?
  1. Easy. Easy to learn.
  2. Secured Feature. Java has a secured feature that helps develop a virus-free and tamper-free system for users.
  3. OOP. OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. OOP signifies that in Java everything is considered an object.
  4. Platform Independent. Java is compiled into platform-independent bytecode. This code is interpreted by the Virtual Machine on which the platform runs.

Define package in Java.
  The package is a collective bundle of classes and interfaces and the necessary libraries and JAR files. The use of packages helps in code reusability.

Differentiate between instance and local variables.
  For instance, variables are declared inside a class and the scope of variables is limited to only a specific object while a local variable can be anywhere inside a method or a specific block of code and also the scope is limited to the code segment where the variable is declared.

What is an exception?
  An exception handling in Java is considered an unexpected event that can disrupt the program's normal flow. These events can be fixed through the process of Exception Handling.

How do exceptions affect the program if it doesn't handle them?
  If you don't deal with exceptions once it occurs the program will end and the code after the line where the exception occurred won't run.

What is the final keyword in Java?
  The term final is a predefined word in Java that is used while declaring values to variable. When a value is declared using the final keyword, then the variable's value remains constant throughout the program's execution.

What is the difference between the program and the process?
  A program is a collection of codes necessary to carry out a specific operation. When a progrmam is run, an active instance of the program called a process is launched. A process is begun by a program once is has run. The process carries out the program's specific instructions.

What is the difference between constructor and method of a class in Java?
  A method is a group of statements that work together to complete a certain tasks and return the outcome to the caller while the method has the option of working without returning anything.

Why does the java array start with 0?
  The distance from the array's beginning is just an offset. There is no distance because the first element is at the beginning of the array. Consequently, the offset is 0.

Define System.out.println().
  It outputs the argument that was supplied to it. On the moitor, the println() method displays the findings. An objectname is typically used to call a method.

What is the best way to inject dependency? Also, state the reason.
  Constructor injection. A class requesting its dependencies through its function Object() is the most typical instance of dependency injection. Since the client cannot be constructed without the required dependencies, this guaranteed that it is always in a correct state.

Explain "this" keyword in java.
  The "this" is used to refer to the current class properties like method, instance, variable and constructors.

Explain "super" keyword in java.
  The "super" keyword refers to the immediate parent class object.

Explain the term enumeration in Java.
  Enumeration or enum is an interface in Java. Enum allows the sequential access of the elements stored in a collection in Java.

What is JDBC?
  JDBC means Java Database Connector. It is used to establish connectivity between an existing database and a Java application.
